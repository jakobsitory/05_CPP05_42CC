# **C++ Module 05**

This repository contains solutions to various C++ programming challenges from the 42 School curriculum. Each module is designed to deepen students' understanding of different programming concepts and techniques.

## **Exercises**

### **ex00 - Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat!**
A class that simulates a bureaucrat with specific attributes and behaviors.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a `Bureaucrat` class with attributes such as name and grade.
- Demonstrating the use of constructors, destructors, and member functions.
- Managing exceptions for invalid grades.

### **ex01 - Form up, maggots!**
A form class that can be signed by bureaucrats.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a `Form` class with attributes such as name, sign grade, and execute grade.
- Creating methods to sign the form and check if it can be executed.
- Demonstrating the interaction between the `Bureaucrat` and `Form` classes.

### **ex02 - No, you need form 28B, not 28C...**
Specific types of forms and handling their execution.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing derived classes from the `Form` class for specific form types.
- Overriding methods to handle the execution of specific forms.
- Demonstrating polymorphism and the use of derived classes.

### **ex03 - At least this beats coffee-making**
A central office that manages multiple forms and bureaucrats.

**Key objectives included:**

- Implementing a central office class to manage forms and bureaucrats.
- Demonstrating the interaction between multiple forms and bureaucrats.
- Ensuring proper resource management and state handling.
